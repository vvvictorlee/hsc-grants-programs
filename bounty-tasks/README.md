Let's build HSC together

Forum post: https://forum.hsc.network/t/topic/2045

# Background
For the past year, HSC Network has been committed to building Web3.0 – a world with a privacy umbrella for personal identity and personal data. We have established multiple product lines to realize this vision, including TEE hardware miners, Dark Wallet, poc3, Pdiem, W3A, and more. The codebase is becoming more abundant, and our code activity ranks among the top ten in the Polkadot ecosystem.

HSC has decided to establish a “Code Bounty Pool,” recruiting “Bounty Hunters” from around the world to jointly build Web3.0 with HSC! All hunters can capture bounty by submitting code. When your proposed code is approved by the official team, you will get your bounty!


# Code Bounty Tasks
### 💁 Who can become a Bounty Hunter?
Any developers can claim a task, and as long as you complete it as required, you can get the bounty!

### :computer: How to become a Bounty Hunter and get Code Bounty
The HSC Bounties are a tiered system, ranging from a few simple lines of code to a complete function. Whatever your level or available time, there’s a Bounty for you!


| Task Level | Issue Tag | Common Task Types | Expected Task Time | Bounty |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Primary	| bounty-xs	| Fix bugs / optimize code / documentation	| Under 2 hours |	1-5 USD equivalent in HOO |
| Advanced	| bounty-s | Optimize the code / complete a small function | Under 10 hours	| About 100 USD equivalent in HOO |
| Expert	| No Tag |	For tasks that cannot be quantified in advance, bounties are assessed through discussions with the team	| Unlimited |	Set relative to the difficulty of completing the task, as evaluated by the technical team |
| :mag_right: Mining related | No Tag	| We also welcome you to submit mining-related tools, plug-ins, etc., for the benefit of the miner community.	| Can be submitted at any time	|Set relative to the difficulty of completing the task, as evaluated by the technical team |


1. Go to the HSC task list. Tasks with the `bounty-xs/s` tag are fixed-price tasks, and the tasks without these tags are unpriced tasks. Select a problem you want to solve, leave a message under the corresponding task to earn the “right to contribute” to this task, and you’ve become a Bounty Hunter.
2. Do the work to solve the problem in the task. Note that the solution you provide needs to meet the requirements stated in the task.
3. Submit a proper PR.
4. When you completed, leave a message in the [Forum under the Bounty Hunter post](https://forum.hsc.network/t/topic/2045)  with **task name + task link + PR link + erc20 address (non-exchange)**, and any relevant comments.
5. Wait for review by the technical team. If the PR passes review, a confirmation reply will be posted, and the bonus will then be issued to your account within 2 weeks.

### 🎤 Bounty donation
In addition to the tasks bountied by the official team, you can propose a new Issue for code that you think is valuable to the bounty program codebase *(note that serious vulnerabilities should not be posted as Issues; please follow Responsible Disclosure practices and send to cert@hsc.network)*. Community members who recognize the Issue and find it worthy of support can donate Bounty on the Issue. Any donated amounts will be distributed to the Bounty Hunter who completes and claims the task.

Users in the community can also donate directly to Bounty Hunters who have made contributions. Whenever you think that the contributions of a Bounty Hunter are of great help to the community, you are encouraged to send donations to the address submitted by that Bounty Hunter in the forum.

*(Do not send donations to unknown addresses.)*

### 🎖Bounty Hunter Wall of Honor
Every few weeks to a month, we will update the Bounty Hunter Wall of Honor with the names of Bounty Hunter who have won bounty to thank the Hunters for their contributions and encourage more developers to take up the hunt.


# FAQ
> How to start developing?
> 
Prepare a dev environment (these docs are mostly up-to-date, but pruntime & phost have been moved to standalone/ directory): 1.1 Run a Local Development Network | HSC Network Wiki

> What if submitted code does not pass review?
> 
You can join HSC’s Discord technical community, communicate with the technical team, and receive guidance on improving the code.

> I want to submit a new task that is not in the Issue list
> 
Very welcome! You can directly submit a PR to the code base and leave a comment at the bottom of this post to explain the new features.

> Why did the submitted task not receive a response?
> 
Don’t worry, the technical team will review your code in time and give a reply. Please be patient.

> When the solution involves multiple contributors, how is the bounty distributed?
> 
The first hunter who submits a solution will be rewarded. Of course, we will also consider subsequent submission participants as appropriate.

> How to receive the rewards?
> 
HOO are currently erc20 tokens, and the rewards will be published to the erc20 prize collection tool (which will incur an eth handling fee), or you can choose to wait until mainnet is online to receive the mainnet HOO (with much lower fees). How To Claim Your HOO Reward 2
